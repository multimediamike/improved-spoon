## Tsunami Tools
These tools are build to operate on the data files found in Tsunami games. Presently, they are primarily built to handle the R2RW.RLB file from the game [Return to Ringworld](http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/return-to-ringworld).

1. unpack-rlb-file.py: This Python script digs through the RLB file and finds all of the text strings and fonts. It collects all of the text strings and dumps them into a files in the format 'messages-####.json.txt', according to the resource ID of the message block. It dumps the font resources into files named 'resource-font-##.dat', according to the font resource ID.
2. repack-rlb-file.py: This Python script takes an original RLB file and transfers the contents to a new RLB file, locating modified scripts and fonts in the process and incorporating them in the new RLB resource file.
3. unpack_tsunami_font.py: This Python script unpacks the individual characters in a Tsunami font file into a sequence of Portable Grey Map (PGM) files which can be edited with a text editor. This is called from unpack-rlb-file.py. It should not be necessary to invoke directly except for debugging.
4. pack_tsunami_font.py: This Python script finds a sequence of PGM files and encodes them into a new Tsunami font file. This is called from repack-rlb-file.py. It should not be necessary to invoke directly except for debugging.

## Missing on Lost Island
The Python script `missing-on-lost-island/extract-data-files.py` is able to disassemble the files stored inside the Data.dat file of the game [Missing on Lost Island](http://www.mobygames.com/game/missing-on-lost-island).
